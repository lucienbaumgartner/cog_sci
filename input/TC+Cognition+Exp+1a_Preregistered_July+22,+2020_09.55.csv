Secondly, technically the same rule as above also applies here: ""to me"" means directly to you, ""for me"" might mean that others are the ones who care, though in this case this difference is very small, and somehow the ""for me"" sounds a tiny bit worse or more awkward. So:

All that matters to me is how much it will cost.

= eg. I don't care about the time it'll take, I just care about the price.
